# Quick Start Guide - Project Management & Architecture Framework

## Welcome! üöÄ

This guide will help you get started with the Project Management & Architecture Framework in under 30 minutes. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up your first project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [ ] Basic understanding of project management concepts
- [ ] Access to the framework directory
- [ ] Required permissions to create/modify files
- [ ] Team members identified (if working with a team)

## Step 1: Project Initialization (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Choose Your Project Type

Select the type of project you're working on:

- **üåê Web Application**: Frontend + Backend web services
- **üì± Mobile Application**: Native or cross-platform mobile apps
- **üíª Desktop Application**: Desktop software applications
- **üîß API/Backend Service**: APIs, microservices, backend systems
- **üìä Data Analytics**: Data processing, analytics, BI projects
- **ü§ñ AI/ML Project**: Machine learning, AI model development

### 1.2 Create Project Directory

```bash
# Navigate to your workspace
cd /path/to/your/workspace

# Create project directory
mkdir my-project-name
cd my-project-name

# Copy framework templates
cp -r /path/to/project-framework/templates ./templates
cp -r /path/to/project-framework/agents ./agents
cp /path/to/project-framework/guides/getting-started/project-setup-checklist.md ./
```

### 1.3 Initialize Project Configuration

Create your project configuration file:

```yaml
# project-config.yaml
project:
  name: "My Project Name"
  type: "web_application"  # Choose from: web_application, mobile_app, desktop_app, api_service, data_analytics, ai_ml
  phase: "initiation"
  start_date: "2024-01-15"
  estimated_duration: "12 weeks"
  
team:
  project_manager: "Your Name"
  tech_lead: "Tech Lead Name"
  team_size: 5
  
ai_agents:
  enabled: true
  project_manager_agent: true
  architect_agent: true
  developer_agent: false  # Enable as needed
```

## Step 2: Project Charter Creation (10 minutes)

### 2.1 Use the Project Charter Template

1. Open `templates/project-management/project-charter.md`
2. Fill in the basic project information:
   - Project name and unique identifier
   - Key stakeholders and their roles
   - High-level objectives and success criteria
   - Initial scope boundaries

### 2.2 Quick Charter Checklist

Complete these essential sections:

- [ ] **Project Information**: Name, dates, budget, priority
- [ ] **Executive Summary**: 2-3 paragraph overview
- [ ] **Primary Objectives**: 3-5 SMART goals
- [ ] **Scope Definition**: What's in/out of scope
- [ ] **Key Stakeholders**: Primary decision makers
- [ ] **High-Level Requirements**: Top 5-10 requirements
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes

### 2.3 AI Agent Assistance

If you have AI agents enabled:

```bash
# Use the PM agent to help create your charter
python agents/project-manager/charter-assistant.py \
  --input "project-config.yaml" \
  --template "templates/project-management/project-charter.md" \
  --output "project-charter.md"
```

## Step 3: Architecture Planning (10 minutes)

### 3.1 System Context Analysis

For technical projects, complete the system context:

1. **Identify External Systems**: What systems will yours integrate with?
2. **Define User Types**: Who will use your system?
3. **List Key Interfaces**: APIs, databases, third-party services

### 3.2 Technology Stack Selection

Use the architecture agent to help select technologies:

```bash
# Get technology recommendations
python agents/architect/tech-recommender.py \
  --project-type "web_application" \
  --requirements "requirements.txt" \
  --constraints "constraints.yaml"
```

### 3.3 Quick Architecture Decisions

Make these key decisions:

- [ ] **Architecture Pattern**: Monolith, Microservices, Serverless
- [ ] **Frontend Technology**: React, Vue, Angular, etc.
- [ ] **Backend Technology**: Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- [ ] **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- [ ] **Hosting/Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise

## Step 4: Project Planning (15 minutes)

### 4.1 Create Work Breakdown Structure

1. Open `templates/project-management/work-breakdown-structure.md`
2. Customize the phases for your project type
3. Break down high-level deliverables into tasks

### 4.2 Effort Estimation

For each major task group:

- **Simple tasks**: 1-8 hours
- **Medium tasks**: 1-3 days
- **Complex tasks**: 1-2 weeks
- **Major features**: 2-4 weeks

### 4.3 Resource Planning

Define your team structure:

```yaml
# team-structure.yaml
roles:
  - name: "Project Manager"
    allocation: 50%
    responsibilities: ["planning", "coordination", "reporting"]
    
  - name: "Frontend Developer"
    allocation: 100%
    responsibilities: ["ui_development", "frontend_testing"]
    
  - name: "Backend Developer"
    allocation: 100%
    responsibilities: ["api_development", "database_design"]
    
  - name: "QA Engineer"
    allocation: 75%
    responsibilities: ["test_planning", "quality_assurance"]
```

## Step 5: Set Up Monitoring & Communication (5 minutes)

### 5.1 Communication Plan

Set up your communication channels:

- **Daily Standups**: Team sync (15 minutes)
- **Weekly Status**: Stakeholder updates
- **Bi-weekly Reviews**: Sprint/iteration reviews
- **Monthly Reports**: Executive summaries

### 5.2 Project Dashboard

Create a simple project dashboard:

```markdown
# Project Dashboard

## Current Status
- Phase: Planning
- Progress: 15% complete
- Next Milestone: Architecture Review (Date)
- Risk Level: Green

## Key Metrics
- Tasks Completed: 5/45
- Budget Used: $5,000/$50,000
- Team Velocity: 12 story points/week
- Quality Score: 95%

## Current Focus
- [ ] Complete architecture design
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Finalize team assignments
```

## Step 6: AI Agent Configuration (5 minutes)

### 6.1 Enable Relevant Agents

Based on your project, enable appropriate AI agents:

```bash
# Configure PM agent for daily assistance
cp agents/project-manager/pm-agent-config.yaml ./pm-agent.yaml

# Configure architect agent for design decisions
cp agents/architect/architect-agent-config.yaml ./architect-agent.yaml
```

### 6.2 Set Up Automated Workflows

Configure automated assistance:

```yaml
# automation-config.yaml
workflows:
  daily_standup:
    enabled: true
    time: "09:00"
    participants: ["team_members"]
    
  progress_tracking:
    enabled: true
    frequency: "daily"
    metrics: ["task_completion", "velocity", "blockers"]
    
  risk_monitoring:
    enabled: true
    frequency: "weekly"
    thresholds:
      schedule_variance: 10%
      budget_variance: 5%
```

- **Architect Agent**: Technical design and decision support
- **Developer Agent**: Code generation and review assistance

### Common Issues
1. **"I don't know where to start"** ‚Üí Follow this guide step by step
2. **"The scope seems too big"** ‚Üí Break it down further in the WBS
3. **"Technology choices are overwhelming"** ‚Üí Use the architect agent
4. **"Team coordination is difficult"** ‚Üí Implement daily standups
5. **"Stakeholders want changes"** ‚Üí Use the change management process

## Success Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a minimal viable scope
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Use short cycles and frequent feedback
3. **Communicate Often**: Over-communicate rather than under-communicate
4. **Document Decisions**: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
5. **Measure Progress**: Track metrics that matter
6. **Adapt and Learn**: Be ready to adjust based on feedback
